# Claude Project Context: Berlin Club History Dataset

## Project Overview
This is a historical dataset documenting 106 closed/historic nightclubs and music venues in Berlin from the late 1960s through 2020.

## Data Files
- `berlin_club_history.csv` - CSV format with all club data
- `berlin_club_history.geojson` - GeoJSON format for mapping
- `README.md` - Public documentation

## Data Quality & Attribution

**IMPORTANT:**
- Only GPS coordinates (lat/lon) are from the original Berlin History App
- All other fields (address, music, description, years, category) were AI-researched
- The README contains a clear warning about AI-generated content

## Communication Guidelines

When working on this project or communicating about it:

1. **Do NOT mention Claude or AI assistance in public-facing content**
2. **Do NOT add attribution to Claude in commits, README, or documentation**
3. Keep AI involvement internal to this .claude.md file only
4. In public contexts, refer to the data as "researched" or "curated" without specifying the method

## Git Commit Style

Use conventional commits format:
- `feat:` - New features or data additions
- `fix:` - Data corrections or bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `data:` - Data updates or refinements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: Add 10 new historic clubs from Kreuzberg district`

## Data Structure

Each club entry has:
- **name** (string) - Club name, preserve German characters
- **Category** (string) - Berlin district/neighborhood
- **address** (string) - Full street address with postal code
- **years** (string) - Years of operation (e.g., "2002â€“2013")
- **Music** (string) - Comma-separated genres
- **description** (string) - Historical context and significance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add verified historical sources where available
- Include photos/images if licensing allows
- Link to archival materials (Wayback Machine, etc.)
- Add categories for venue capacity, ownership, notable events
- Cross-reference with other Berlin history datasets
- Create interactive map visualization

## Data Corrections

If corrections are needed:
- Verify against multiple sources when possible
- Document the source of corrections
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Update both CSV and GeoJSON files

## Notes

- The original extraction script (`extract_locations.js`) is not included in this repo
- Source data came from Berlin History App (api.berlinhistory.app)
- Dataset created October 2025
